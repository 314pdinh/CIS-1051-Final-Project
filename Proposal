# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

What'sMyMeal

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Create an app(ios) or a program that generates a recipe based on the user's choice  

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will provides the recipe based on the selected options. The telegram bot will generate a recipe from the imported random and list. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program will be able to provide the recipes after the user's choose the command. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can make this program work, being able to allow the telegram bot to provide the recipe. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

My project would generate a couple of recipes based on users' choice. I would also like to add a cocktail recipe generator just for fun. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Creating a telegram bots would be a great skill to have to create an automation bot. I will learn the basic functions of creating a telegram bot that will send message to its own command handlers.
