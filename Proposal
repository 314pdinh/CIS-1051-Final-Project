# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

What'sMyMeal

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Create an app(ios) or a program that generates a recipe based on the input ingredients  

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will provides the recipe based on the ingredients that the user will input. The telegram bot is linked to the website spoonacular, so it will scrape the recipes from the website matching the ingredients. To collect data, the telegram bot will have an API of its own to perform its own task, while connecting to the website API to collect data. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program will be able to provide the recipes after comparing the input's ingredients. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can make this program work, being able to allow the telegram bot to provide the recipe based on the ingredients inputs. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

My project would generate a couple of recipes based on users' ingredient input and their preference of food type. I would also like to add a cocktail recipe just for fun. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Creating a telegram bots would be a great skill to have to create an automation bot. I will also learn to how to connect APIs together. A bot to gather data, and a website to provide data. I will need to learn how to set up virtual environments, and imports functions. And finally using terminals to perform testing.
