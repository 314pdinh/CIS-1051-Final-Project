## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

#1. Build an assisted AI that tracks the housing market and recommend the best house based on user's preference. 
#2. Create a mobile app that provides the location of groceries from other cultures. For instance, provides location for filipino foods or ingredients.
#3. Maybe combine an assisted AI with the app? 
#4. create a game similar to 2d Mortal Kombat with a twist of my own by changing the filter of screen based on player's hp, or make the screen black(blindfold) when the player is winning by a significant points.
