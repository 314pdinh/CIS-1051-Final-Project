Project Title: What'sMyMeal (Recipe Generator)

Summary:
Ever wonder what's for meal? I created this program, What'sMyMeal, where a telegram bot, Mr. Chef, that can be accessible on any smart devices to generate a random recipes based on your choosing. Just chat with Mr. Chef, and it will guide you step by step to help you find your delicious random recipe. Plus there's a bonus and tips for you.  

Thoughts: 
This project proves to be challenging for me. It was difficult to connect the telegram bot to extract the data from the websites. The concepts of API Keys are difficult to understand and to perform. Instead of using data from the websites, I created my own data using recipes from the websites, and putting them into a list. Throughout this project, I learned how to code a functions in telegram to execute its command, using the message handler, command handler, updater, dispatcher, and markup keyboard. Even though I didn't program the project the way it was intended, I was still able to make the bot to generate a random recipe based on the given data in the file. It was rewarding and fun to see the end results. I will improve this project by extracting the data from the websites using the API Keys. 

Technologies used: Python, telegram, telegram-Bot
